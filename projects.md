## [Wireguard VPN on Digital Ocean](assets/vpn-project)
-This project documents the end-to-end deployment of a WireGuard VPN server hosted on a DigitalOcean droplet. I generated and managed key pairs, configured both server and client profiles, and successfully connected multiple devices (iOS and Windows) to securely tunnel internet traffic. The process highlights practical skills in Linux administration, secure networking, and troubleshooting real-world connectivity issues.

## Vulnerability Assessment Lab (Nmap + OpenVAS)
- Scanned a vulnerable VM (Metasploitable) using Nmap and OpenVAS.
- Documented vulnerabilities and provided remediation steps.
- Tools: Nmap, OpenVAS, Kali Linux

## Azure Security Basics
- Deployed a secure Azure VM with firewall rules and RBAC.
- Enabled MFA for administrator login and configured backups.

## Phishing Email Analysis
- Dissected a mock phishing email using header analysis and sandboxing techniques.

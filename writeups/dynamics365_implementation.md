# Microsoft Dynamics 365 Implementation – Instructional Design Across CE & Finance and Operations

Throughout multiple Dynamics 365 implementation projects, I served as an **Instructional Designer** supporting both **Customer Engagement (CE)** and **Finance and Operations (F&O)** modules. These roles gave me a broad perspective on enterprise systems, from CRM workflows to complex financial operations.

## Key Contributions:

- **Created user documentation and training content** for Sales, Customer Service, Finance, Procurement, and Supply Chain Management modules.
- **Simplified technical configurations and business workflows** into engaging instructional materials to support smooth user adoption.
- **Worked closely with consultants, SMEs, and change management teams** to align training with system configuration and business needs.
- **Supported secure role-based access documentation**, enabling teams to understand permissions and data security within the platform.

These experiences reinforced my ability to translate system complexity into user-friendly formats, while remaining attentive to **security practices and operational compliance**—a foundation that complements my growth in the cybersecurity domain.

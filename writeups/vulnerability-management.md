# 🕵️ What is Vulnerability Management?

Vulnerability management is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, focusing on identifying and reducing risks in systems and software before they can be exploited.

## 🔍 1. Identify Vulnerabilities

- Use scanning tools like **Nmap**, **Nessus**, or **OpenVAS**.
- Discover open ports, outdated software, and system misconfigurations.

---

## 🧠 2. Assess Risk

- Prioritize vulnerabilities using **CVSS scores**.
- Consider exploitability, asset sensitivity, and business impact.

---

## 🛠️ 3. Remediate Issues

- Patch or update vulnerable software.
- Disable unnecessary services.
- Implement segmentation and stronger access controls.

---

## 🔄 4. Re-Scan and Validate

- Re-run vulnerability scans after remediation.
- Ensure vulnerabilities are closed and no new ones have appeared.

---

## 🧾 5. Report and Improve

- Document actions taken for compliance and auditing.
- Improve configurations and update policies to prevent future risks.

# 🎣 Top 5 Phishing Red Flags

Phishing emails are crafted to trick recipients into giving up sensitive information, clicking malicious links, or downloading malware. Here are five key signs that an email might be a phishing attempt:

---

## 🚨 1. Urgent or Threatening Language

> “Your account will be suspended in 24 hours unless you verify your information.”

Phishing emails often create a false sense of urgency to pressure the victim into acting quickly. Be cautious of emails demanding immediate action.

---

## 👻 2. Spoofed Email Addresses or Domains

> `support@amaz0n.com`, `admin@micros0ft-security.com`

Attackers register lookalike domains or forge display names. Always check the actual sender’s address carefully — don’t rely on the name shown.

---

## 🔗 3. Suspicious or Unexpected Links

> Hover over a link before clicking. A button saying “Log in to PayPal” might actually link to `http://malicious-site.com/login`.

Avoid clicking unexpected links. If in doubt, visit the website directly instead of clicking through the email.

---

## 📝 4. Poor Spelling and Grammar

> “Your acount has been compromized. Click here imediately.”

Many phishing emails contain grammar issues or typos. These are red flags that the message is not from a professional or trusted source.

---

## 📎 5. Unusual Attachments or Requests for Sensitive Information

> “Please open the attached file and complete the form with your SSN and bank details.”

Be extremely wary of attachments or emails requesting personal, financial, or login credentials. Legitimate organizations rarely ask for such information via email.

## 🛡️ How to Protect Yourself

- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.
- Double-check URLs and sender addresses.
- Never download or open unexpected attachments.
- Report suspicious emails to your IT or security team.

# Oracle ERP Implementation – Instructional Design with a Security-Conscious Approach

As part of a large-scale Oracle ERP implementation, I served as the **Instructional Designer** responsible for creating end-user training and documentation. While my primary focus was on crafting effective learning materials, this role provided valuable exposure to core enterprise systems and the underlying operational processes—many of which intersect with cybersecurity principles such as role-based access control, data integrity, and least privilege.

## Key Contributions:

- **Developed training documentation** for workflows across modules such as Finance, Procurement, and HR within Oracle Cloud ERP.
- **Translated technical system processes** into accessible content for non-technical audiences, ensuring smooth onboarding and operational adoption.
- **Collaborated cross-functionally** with system architects, security teams, and functional leads to ensure documentation aligned with security protocols and compliance standards.
- **Gained hands-on insight** into how enterprise systems manage user permissions, sensitive data, and audit trails—core areas of focus in cybersecurity.

This project deepened my appreciation for the intersection of **user enablement, secure system design,** and **enterprise risk management**—insights I continue to build on as I grow in the cybersecurity field.

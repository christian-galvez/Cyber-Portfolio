      <h1>üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Cowrie SSH Honeypot on DigitalOcean</h1>
      <p><strong>One-line summary:</strong> This project involved deploying Cowrie, a medium-interaction SSH honeypot, on a DigitalOcean droplet. 
      The honeypot is designed to log brute-force attempts, shell interaction, and file transfers made by unauthorized users.</p>
    </section>
  <main>
    <h2>üéØ Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Deploy Cowrie in a secure, isolated environment.</li>
      <li>Capture unauthorized login attempts and attacker activity.</li>
      <li>Learn the pitfalls of configuring a honeypot in a modern Linux environment (Ubuntu 24.04).</li>
      <li>Build real-world troubleshooting experience with Python venvs, system security restrictions, and firewall configuration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Setup Process</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Provisioned a DigitalOcean Ubuntu 24.04 droplet.</li>
      <li>Created a dedicated <code>cowrieuser</code> account (never running Cowrie as root).</li>
      <li>Cloned the Cowrie repository and set up a Python virtual environment.</li>
      <li>Resolved PEP 668 issues with Ubuntu‚Äôs ‚Äúexternally managed environments‚Äù by rebuilding the virtual environment as a non-root user.</li>
      <li>Installed dependencies via <code>requirements.txt</code> inside the venv.</li>
      <li>Configured firewall rules and ensured the honeypot port (2222) was exposed externally.</li>
      <li>Launched Cowrie and verified it was logging unauthorized attempts.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>üîß Learning Moments / Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p><strong>Python packaging restrictions (PEP 668):</strong> Ubuntu 24.04 blocks pip installs in system-managed environments. I learned to rebuild the venv properly as a non-root user to avoid externally-managed-environment errors.</p>
    <p><strong>Permission issues:</strong> Accidentally building the venv as root caused Cowrie to point to /root Python paths, breaking execution. Fixing this reinforced the importance of least-privilege operation.</p>
    <p><strong>Firewall configuration:</strong> ‚ÄúConnection timed out‚Äù errors highlighted the need to open honeypot ports both in UFW and in the cloud provider‚Äôs firewall.</p>
    <p><strong>Logs as validation:</strong> Seeing unauthorized SSH attempts appear in Cowrie‚Äôs logs confirmed the deployment was successful and actively interacting with attackers.</p>

    <h2>üìë Results</h2>
    <p>
      Cowrie is actively recording brute force attempts and commands from unauthorized IPs.
      Logs show attacker usernames, password guesses, and attempted commands. 
      This provides both educational insight into real-world attack behavior and data I can use for further analysis projects.
